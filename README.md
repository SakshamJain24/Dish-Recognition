# Dish-Recognition

Our project utilizes Convolution Neural Network(CNN) to accurately identify dishes and provide recipe recommendations. As we continue to develop our skillset, we aim to integrate calorie and nutritional value meters. This application has various use cases, including catering to the curiosity of tourists who can simply scan a dish to instantly learn its name and recipe.
